# AINS-multicopter-simulator
Multicopter simulator with setup for navigation and sensor fusion.

Need to download the GNS-toolbox from https://github.com/cybergalactic/MSS and add folder to path (done automatically in script)

Known issues: Must rewrite q2euler in GNS-toolbox to return a vector rather than three separate values.
